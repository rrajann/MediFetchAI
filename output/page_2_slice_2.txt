 
The Outstanding International Student Award applies to the degree program on the Vancouver 
campus to which you have been admitted; the award is not transferable to any other UBC campus or 
to another academic institution. 
 
The Outstanding International Student Award funds are applied directly toward your tuition and fees 
in two equal, scheduled installments – one in September and one in January. Your tuition and fee 
balance will be adjusted after registration and eligibility have been verified. 
To receive the Outstanding International Student Award monies in your first year you must: 
 Enroll as a full-time undergraduate student and maintain registration in a minimum of 24.0 
percentage-graded credits in your first-year Winter Session (September 2021 through April 2022) at
