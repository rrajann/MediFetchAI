This is the equilibrium because if UBC Complies SFU would choose cheat (1200 > -
800) and if UBC Cheats SFU would also choose cheat (0 > -200). 
 
And, if SFU Complies UBC would choose cheat (1200 > -800) and if SFU Cheats UBC 
would also choose cheat (0 > -200). 
 
For both firms the dominant strategy is to choose cheat â€“ this is the Nash 
Equilibrium and both will earn zero profits.
