c. If total fixed cost in this industry is $16 and the marginal cost is given above, 
calculate average total cost and profit when the firm produces the profit 
maximizing level of output. Illustrate the firms profit on the graph. [3 MARKS] 
 
ATC = AFC + AVC = FC / Q + MC = 16/4 + 6 = $10 
Profit = TR – TC = (P X Q) – ATC X Q = 18 X 4 – 10 X 4 = 8 X 4 = $32
