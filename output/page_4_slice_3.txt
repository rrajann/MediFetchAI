2. Two food trucks, Unbelievable Burgers and Chips (UBC) and Super Flatbreads 
Uncooked (SFU), set up on campus. If both comply with a cartel agreement to 
restrict the portions of food sold 100 each, they each earn an economic profit of 
$800. If one quietly increases their output to 200 and the other complies with the 
cartel agreement, the cheater makes an economic profit of $1200 and the 
complier suffers an economic loss of $200. If both firms cheat on the cartel they 
both make an economic profit of $0.
